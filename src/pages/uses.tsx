            <Tool title="Linux">
              I picked up using Linux in 2011, Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narhwal was my
              first distro, I then started the never ending quest of
              distro-hopping. I&apos;ve spent at least a couple months using
              Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Arch
              Linux.

            <Tool title="NeoVim">
              The modal style of editing was very interesting to me early in my
              experiences with Linux, after I rebooted my computer to exit it
              for the first time.

              I got this from eBay for a little over $200, upgraded the RAM to
              16GB and put in a 1TB SSD, and also found a matching docking
              station for it.

            <Tool title="ZSA Moonlander">
              The Moonlander is amazing keyboard, I love being able to program
              custom layers of different key layouts and switch between them
              easily. The per-key LEDs are also really cool to highlight which
              keys are enabled and color coordinate their functionality.
              <br />I was fortunate to buy this second-hand from a friend at
              half-price.

            <Tool title="Cheap off-primary touchpad">
              Something about using a touchpad with gestures makes me feel like
              a wizard with special powers. I really like feeling like a wizard
              with special powers.

              I sit in a chair, it&apos;s a very a generic-looking office chair,
              more comfortable than it looks, probably.

            <Tool title="A mix of cymbals">
              Mostly Zildjian A/K Cymbals, and recently an 18” Saluda Earthworks

            <Tool title="Pearl Demon-Drive pedals">
              I wanted to learn how to play double-strokes with my feet,
              I&apos;ve loved playing with these pedals ever since.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Roland TM-2 module and RT-30K trigger">
              I like to cheat at drums and use electronics to help improve
              clarity and consistency of my sound, especially when playing metal
              at over 200bpm. Plus it sounds like a machine gun. Double bass go
              brrrrrrrrrrrr.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Zoom Q8 camera">
              I saw a good deal on this a few months before Covid and bought it
              on a whim and it helped me start up my online drum lessons really
              easily, the built in microphones don&apos;t distort in loud
              settings, and being able to record or stream other microphones or
              mixes is a killer feature for a camera that doubles as a webcam.

            <Tool title="A mix of microphones">
              Currently I have a few Sennheisers e604s and some Audix D-series,

            <Tool title="Midas MR18 digital mixer/interface">
              I got this to replace a small 12-channel Behringer Xenyx. I still
              barely know how to use this thing, and I keep hoping that one day
              someone will finally explain to me how to properly work the
              compressor.

            <Tool title="Roland Octopad">
              One summer I was hired to play by the pool at fancy hotel in a
              an enclosed tent that was not large enough to accommadate a full
              size drum set as well as a couple other musicians and their gear,
              and this thing came in great to get me through the gig, as well as
              many other gigs at small clubs over the years, and been a great
              addition to my kit with all of the different sounds it has.
