Getting started with making web APIs can be confusing, even overwhelming at first. I'd like to share my process for creating APIs in Node.js.

## The server

First let's create a `package.json` and add a dependency:

```sh terminal
cd rest_api
npm init -y
npm i express
```

<CH.Scrollycoding>
This is a simple 'hello world' with express:

```javascript index.js
const express = require('express')

const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world!')
})

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Express started on http://localhost:${port}\npress Ctrl+C to terminate.`)
})
```

---

Express is imported, then an instance is created and saved as `app`.

```javascript index.js focus=1:3
```

---

`app.get()` tells the Express instance to listen for `GET` requests to the specified route; here it's just `/`. When this route is requested, the given callback is fired, in this case it sends the string "Hello world!" as a response.

```javascript index.js focus=5:7
```

---

`port` is declared as a variable which can be set from the environment, or otherwise defaults to `3000` if none is specified. Express then listens on that port, and after the server has finally started it uses `console.log` to print a message in the terminal.

```javascript index.js focus=9:12
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

Assuming everything went okay, you should then be able to run `node index.js` and point your browser at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and see the message "Hello world!"

---

Another way to test this instead of opening your browser is with either [cURL][curl] or [postman][postman]. cURL is great if you're the command-line junkie type (like me), postman is really pretty and slick but a bit too much hassle for me.

[curl]: https://curl.haxx.se
[postman]: https://getpostman.com

Once you have curl installed it should be as simple to get your Hello World in the shell with:

```sh terminal
curl localhost:3000
```

## Request parameters

A server that only responds with the same thing every time isn't very fun though. Let's make a new route that allows us to say hello when passed a name:

```javascript index.js focus=7:9
const app = express()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello world!')
})

app.get('/:name', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Hello ${req.params.name}!`)
})
```

You'll want to add this before the `app.listen()` command so that it gets registered properly.

Then, with curl:

```sh terminal
curl localhost:3000/foo
```

You should see "Hello foo!"

## Automatic restart

To get the above change working, you first have to stop the server and then restart it again, which can get fairly annoying after a few changes. [nodemon][nodemon] can be installed to watch for changes and restart automatically.

[nodemon]: https://nodemon.io/

```sh terminal
npm i nodemon
```

Then alter your package.json so that it looks like this:

```json package.json bg=2
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon -w '*' -x 'node index.js'",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```

Now you can run `npm start` and it will use nodemon to watch for changes and restart the server.

## The database

Before making a database, you should first identify your data and what you'll be doing with it. I spent about 30 seconds debating what kind of data to use in this tutorial, and decided to do "something" with movies.

Among other things, a movie would have a title and a date it was released, and that seems like enough to work with for now.

I don't want to go into setting up and configuring a big fancy database, so we will [SQLite][sqlite], a [RDBMS][rdbms] that uses files to represent databases, and doesn't require a background processes to store or retrieve data. If you prefer PostgreSQL or MariaDB feel free to use those, you should only have to adjust a couple of things.

[sqlite]: https://sqlite.org/
[rdbms]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system

```sh terminal
npm i sqlite3 knex
```

Rather than interacting with the database directly, we're going to use a query builder called [knex][knex]. knex allows you to write your queries in plain JavaScript, which provides an abstraction layer over your database driver. This makes it so your queries aren't necessarily tied to a specific database engine, and if you want to change to a different database later it's a much less difficult migration, sometimes only just a few lines.

[knex]: http://knexjs.org

`knex` has a really great cli. We can use it to create a default config:

```sh terminal
npx knex init
```

Have a look at the file it creates at `knexfile.js`

In a new file, perhaps called `db.js`, save this:

```javascript db.js
const knex = require('knex')
const config = require('./knexfile.js')
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'

module.exports = knex(config[env])
```

This creates and exports a single knex instance that we can re-use in other modules.

Now let's define a new table using the migrations cli:

```sh terminal
npx knex migrate:make create_movies
```

This will create `migrations/<timestamp>_create_movies.js` with a few empty functions, change it so that it looks like this:

```javascript migrations/01-create_movies.js
exports.up = async knex => {
  return knex.schema.createTable('movies', t => {
    t.increments('id').primary()
    t.string('title')
    t.integer('released')
  })
}

exports.down = async knex => {
  return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists('movies')
}
```

Now, we can use the cli again to create our table:

```sh terminal
npx knex migrate:latest
```

## Data methods

Now that we have a database and a table, we need some methods to populate the table with data.

<CH.Scrollycoding>

```javascript movies.js
const db = require('./db')

async function create({ title, released }) {
  return db('movies').insert({ title, released })
}
```

This creates a function called `create` that accepts an object with keys `title` and `released`, which are purposely the same name as the field names.

---

Now that we can create movies, we should make a way to list them.

```javascript movies.js focus=7:9
const db = require('./db')

async function create({ title, released }) {
  return db('movies').insert({ title, released })
}

async function list() {
  return db('movies').select('*')
}
```

---

To finish up, since this file won't directly consume these functions, we need to export them so they can be used as a module.

```javascript movies.js focus=11:14
const db = require('./db')

async function create({ title, released }) {
  return db('movies').insert({ title, released })
}

async function list() {
  return db('movies').select('*')
}

module.exports = {
  create,
  list,
}

```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

## Wiring it up

Now let's wire up our database to our server!

Going back to our `index.js`, let's import our new movies file and make a route to use the `list` method so that it looks like this:

```javascript index.js bg=2,6:8
const express = require('express')
const movies = require('./movies')

const app = express()

app.get('/api/v1/movies', async (req, res) => {
  res.json(await movies.list())
})

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(
    `Express started on http://localhost:${port}\npress Ctrl+C to terminate.`
  )
})
```

Requesting the data is the easy part, with curl we can simply:

```sh terminal
curl localhost:3000/api/v1/movies
```

which right now will return an empty JSON array.

## Express middleware

To be able to properly create movies, we need to introduce a piece of express _middleware_.

Middleware are functions that are run before a route handler. They usually alter the request or response objects in some way. There are tons of middleware modules for express, if you'd like to read more you can check out the [offical docs][middleware].

[middleware]: http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html

```javascript index.js
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))
```

Now we can add a route that responds to `POST` requests, and our body data will be available as `req.body`:

```javascript index.js bg=12:15
const express = require('express')
const movies = require('./movies')

const app = express()

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))

app.get('/api/v1/movies', async (req, res) => {
  res.json(await movies.list())
})

app.post('/api/v1/movies', async (req, res) => {
  const { title, released } = req.body
  res.json(await movies.create({ title, released }))
})

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(
    `Express started on http://localhost:${port}\npress Ctrl+C to terminate.`
  )
})
```

Using curl we can now insert data with:

```sh terminal
curl -X POST -d 'released=2017' -d 'title=nothing good' localhost:3000/api/v1/movies
```

Which will return the new number of rows.

## Full CRUD support

Any good API endpoint usually provides [four methods][crud]:

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

[crud]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete

We only have the first two, so let's finish it up and add the others.

Back in our `movies.js` let's add two more functions:

```javascript movies.js focus=11:21
const db = require('./db')

async function create({ title, released }) {
  return db('movies').insert({ title, released })
}

async function list() {
  return db('movies').select('*')
}

async function update({ id, title, released }) {
  return db('movies').update({ title, released }).where({ id })
}

async function del(id) {
  return db('movies').where({ id }).del()
}
```

Then we need to update our exports:

```javascript movies.js bg=4,5
module.exports = {
  create,
  list,
  update,
  del,
}
```

Back in the `index.js` file we need to make two more routes:

```javascript index.js bg=17:25
const express = require('express')
const movies = require('./movies')

const app = express()

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))

app.get('/api/v1/movies', async (req, res) => {
  res.json(await movies.list())
})

app.post('/api/v1/movies', async (req, res) => {
  const { title, released } = req.body
  res.json(await movies.create({ title, released }))
})

app.put('/api/v1/movies', async (req, res) => {
  await movies.update(req.body)
  res.json(await movies.list())
})

app.delete('/api/v1/movies', async (req, res) => {
  await movies.del(req.body.id)
  res.json(await movies.list())
})

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(
    `Express started on http://localhost:${port}\npress Ctrl+C to terminate.`
  )
})
```

Now we can edit movies by passing field names as data pieces in curl:

```sh terminal
curl -X PUT -d 'id=1' -d 'title=new title' localhost:3000/api/v1/movies
```

And delete them by passing the id:

```sh terminal
curl -X DELETE -d 'id=1' localhost:3000/api/v1/movies
```

## Conclusion

We learned how to make a single endpoint respond to different actions and query a database with the appropriate methods.
